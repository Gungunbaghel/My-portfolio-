My Portfolio
This project represents my journey in web development, highlighting the skills, projects, and experiences I've gained over time. My portfolio follows a clean and minimal design philosophy, allowing the focus to remain on the content and projects without unnecessary distractions.
I've utilized HTML to structure well-organized and accessible web pages, ensuring ease of navigation. As I continue to grow, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise beyond HTML, diving deeper into CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced technologies to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.---
